``` r
num_vecter = pull(problem1_df, norm_samp)
logical_vecter = pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos)
character_vecter = pull(problem1_df, character_vector)
facter_vector = pull(problem1_df, factor_vector)

mean(num_vecter)
## [1] 0.1322028
mean(logical_vecter)
## [1] 0.6
mean(character_vecter)
## Warning in mean.default(character_vecter): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
## [1] NA
mean(facter_vector)
## Warning in mean.default(facter_vector): argument is not numeric or logical:
## returning NA
## [1] NA
```

-   After trying to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe, the
    numeric variables and logical variables work since they have
    arithmetic values. The logical variables have 1 for True and 0 for
    False. However, the character variables and factor variables do not,
    since they are not numeric or logical.

``` r
as.numeric(logical_vecter) #apply the as.numeric function to the logical variables
as.numeric(character_vecter)  #apply the as.numeric function to the character variables
as.numeric(facter_vector) #apply the as.numeric function to the factor variables
```

-   After applying the as.numeric function, the logical and factor
    variables are converted to the numeric; and the character variables
    are unable to converted to numeric. The logical variables will be
    converted to 1 for True and 0 for False. And the factor variables
    will return the underlying numeric (integer) representation. This is
    because as.numeric attempts to coerce its argument to the numeric
    type, which is often meaningless since it may not correspond to the
    factor levels.

-   The as.numeric function help explain what happens for logical
    variables when trying to take their mean since we can know the ratio
    of True to False from the result. The as.numeric function also helps
    explain what happens for character variables when trying to take
    their mean. Since character variables are not numeric and cannot be
    converted to numeric, their mean will be shown as NA. However, since
    as.numeric function converts its argument to numeric regardless the
    factor levels, it does not help explain what happens for factor
    variables when trying to take their mean.

```

-   Hence, the names included in this “penguins” datasets are: species,
    island, bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm,
    body\_mass\_g, sex, year. And this dataset contains 344 rows and 8
    columns. After excluding the NA values, the mean of flipper length
    is 200.9152047 mm.

-   Since bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, and
    body\_mass\_g are important variables, the mean values of these
    variables are calculated in below R chunk.

``` r
mean_billlength = mean(pull(penguins, bill_length_mm),na.rm = TRUE) 
mean_billdepth = mean(pull(penguins, bill_depth_mm),na.rm = TRUE) 
mean_flipperlength = mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm),na.rm = TRUE) 
mean_bodymass = mean(pull(penguins, body_mass_g),na.rm = TRUE) 
```

-   Hence, the mean of bill\_length\_mm is 43.9219298, mean of
    bill\_depth\_mm is 17.1511696, mean of flipper\_length\_mm is
    200.9152047, and the mean of body\_mass\_g is 4201.754386.

``` r
#scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); 

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "flipper_length_mm vs bill_length_mm")
```
