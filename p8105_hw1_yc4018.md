# Problem 1:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
problem1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1), #random sample (size 10) from standard Normal distribution
    norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, #logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
    vec_char = vector("character", length = 10), #a character vector of length 10
    vec_factor = factor(c("a","a","a","b","b","b","b","c","c","c")) 
        #a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” ?
  )

mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.09542936

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   After trying to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe, the
    random sample variables and logical variables work. But the
    character variables and factor variables do not, since they are not
    numeric or logical.
