# Problem 1:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
problem1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1), #random sample (size 10) from standard Normal distribution
    norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, #logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
    character_vector = vector("character", length = 10), #a character vector of length 10
    factor_vector = factor(c("a","a","a","b","b","b","b","c","c","c")) 
        #a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels” ???
  )

mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.371761

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, character_vector))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(problem1_df, factor_vector))
```

    ## [1] NA

-   After trying to take the mean of each variable in the dataframe, the
    random sample variables and logical variables work. But the
    character variables and factor variables do not, since they are not
    numeric or logical.

``` r
as.numeric(problem1_df$norm_samp_pos) #apply the as.numeric function to the logical variables
as.numeric(problem1_df$character_vector)  #apply the as.numeric function to the character variables
as.numeric(problem1_df$factor_vector) #apply the as.numeric function to the factor variables
```

-   After applying the as.numeric function, the logical and factor
    variables are converted to the numeric; and the character variables
    are unable to converted to numeric. This is because as.numeric
    attempts to coerce its argument to the numeric type, which is often
    meaningless since it may not correspond to the factor levels. Hence,
    this does not help explain what happens when trying to take the
    mean.

# Problem 2:

Hence, the names included in this datasets are: species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. And this dataset contains 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean of
flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.
